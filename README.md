**This repo contains a small practice project where I explored the basics of working with Pandas in Python.**

**The notebook shows how to:**

Create a DataFrame from a dictionary
Check dataset info and summary statistics
Handle missing values and unique values
Filter rows with conditions
Add, modify, and drop columns
Encode categorical values (Male/Female)
Sort data by one or more columns

# What I Learned - 
How to quickly explore a dataset using Pandas
The difference between .map(), .apply(), and .drop()

#Simple ways to filter and transform data
